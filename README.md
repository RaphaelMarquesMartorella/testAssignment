# Front-end with Responsivity Chalenge

- ### Description: Front-end made with Next.Js, TypeScript and Tailwind, with full responsivy and enhanced rendering speed.

- ### Motivation: It was a challenge from the company Clarifion, to translate the figma design into code, and make it with responsivity for a screen with 360 pixel of width, I went further and added to screen of all sizes.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
